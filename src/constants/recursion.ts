    definition : "Recursion is a programming technique that involves calling a function within itself. This allows a function to break down a problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until it reaches a base case, which is a problem that can be solved trivially. The function then returns the results of these subproblems to solve the original problem.",
    keyFeatures : ["Self-Calling Function: Recursion involves a function calling itself directly or indirectly.", "Divide and Conquer Approach: Recursion breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems until reaching a base case.","Problem Solving Strategy: Recursion is used to solve problems by applying the same solution repeatedly to smaller versions of the problem.","Recursive Call Stack: Recursion utilizes a call stack to manage the nested function calls."]
