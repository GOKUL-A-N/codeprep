    definition: " A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of nodes (also called vertices) and a set of edges that connect these nodes. Nodes can represent entities or objects, while edges represent relationships between them. Graphs are versatile data structures that can be used to model a wide variety of real-world problems and situations.",
    explanation: "A graph is an abstract data structure that represents a collection of interconnected objects, called nodes or vertices, and the connections between them, known as edges. These nodes and edges can be interconnected in various ways, forming a complex network of relationships.",
