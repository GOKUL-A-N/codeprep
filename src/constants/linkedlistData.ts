    definition : "A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers ",
    explanation : "Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that they can grow or shrink in size at run-time. ",
