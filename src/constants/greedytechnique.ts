    definition : " A greedy technique, also known as the greedy algorithm, is an algorithmic paradigm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step in the hope of achieving the globally optimal solution. This approach aims to find the best solution by choosing the best option available at each stage, without considering the impact it might have on subsequent decisions.",

        "Local Optimization: Greedy algorithms focus on making the best choice at each step, without considering the overall impact on the final solution.",
        "Constructive Approach: Greedy algorithms incrementally build a solution, adding elements one by one until the complete solution is obtained.",
        "No Backtracking: Once a decision is made, greedy algorithms do not revisit or change earlier choices.",
        "Efficient Implementation: Greedy algorithms are often simple and efficient to implement due to their local decision-making and lack of backtracking."
