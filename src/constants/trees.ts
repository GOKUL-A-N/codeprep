    definition : "A tree is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. The connections between nodes form a hierarchical structure, where each node has one or more child nodes. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the organization of a company, the file system, or a genetic tree.",
    typesOfTrees: ["Binary Trees: Binary trees are trees with each node having at most two child nodes. They are commonly used in algorithms like binary search.","N-ary Trees: N-ary trees allow for more than two child nodes per node. They are often used to represent organizational hierarchies or data structures like XML documents.","Heaps: Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. They are used in algorithms like heapsort and priority queues.","Tries: Tries are trees used for efficient text search and data compression. They are based on the prefix property of words."],
    operations: ["Insertion: Adding a new node to the tree.","Deletion: Removing a node from the tree.","Traversal: Traversing the tree to visit all nodes in a specific order, such as pre-order, in-order, or post-order.","Searching: Finding a particular node in the tree."]
