    definition : "In data structures, searching is the process of finding a particular item within a collection of data. It is a fundamental operation used in various algorithms and applications. The efficiency of searching algorithms is crucial for optimizing the performance of programs that handle large amounts of data.",
    types : ["Sequential Search","Binary Search"],
    SequentialSearch : "Sequential search is a simple and straightforward algorithm that checks each element in the collection sequentially until the desired item is found. It is efficient for small collections but becomes inefficient for larger collections.",
    binarySearch: " Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that is applicable to sorted collections. It repeatedly divides the search space in half, narrowing down the search to the appropriate portion. This process significantly reduces the number of comparisons required compared to sequential search.",
