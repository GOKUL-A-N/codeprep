      <p className='paragraph p-2'>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task. It is a precise and unambiguous set of instructions that can be carried out by a computer or by a human. Algorithms are used in all areas of computer science, from the design of operating systems to the development of artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p className='paragraph p-2'>The word Algorithm means ‚Äù A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations ‚Äù
Or
‚Äù A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations‚Äù.</p>
      <h4 className='heading2 p-2'>Here is a simple example of an algorithm in natural language:</h4>
